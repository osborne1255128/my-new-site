    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The science of high-performing cultures demystified.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my new website page, thanks you all for visiting!!!. 'it feels like the magic is fading,' a senior executive of <em>a prestigious international company</em> explained after he'd summoned us to help rebuild its culture.He knew that culture is crucial to success-and over 90 percent of business leaders agree.But he didn't know how to build a great culture.He didn't know how to prove that culture mattered.And he didn't know where to begin.We wrote <i>primed to perform</i> to reveal the science behind the magic.Over the last two decades, we built upon a century of academic study with our own original research.</p>
    <h2>The science of performance.</h2>
    <p>It's remarkable how little it can take to enhance or destroy work-place performance.Imagine that it is eight o'clock on a<b> monday morning</b>. you're at work, trying to read a fax(people do still send them).Somehow it was garbled in transmission, and you can make out only some of it's text.</p>
    <h3>Culture matters.</h3>
    <p>The total motivation factor is the ultimate culture-building tool, the compass you've always needed to make sure your culture is heading in the right direction.It has enabled us to find data-driven answers to replace the folklore around questions like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What leadership style should you use?</li>
      <li>How do you design motivating jobs and career path?</li>
      <li>How should you manage the performance of your people?</li>
      <li>What is the fairest and most effective compensation philosophy?</li>
      <li>What are the best processes for meaning culture?</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Going forward.</h4>
    <p>To many well-laid business plans fall flat because of mediocre cultures.Too many people are miserable at work.Too many cultures, even great ones, atrophy over time. we to have worked in bad cultures, built bad cultues, and in some cases propagated bad cultures, all without understanding what we were doing.</p>
    <h5>Resource as you read.</h5>
    <p>As you read, you may find it helpful to understand your own levels of total motivation, and the ToMo of your organization.On our website, www.primedtoperform.com, you can take our brief total motivation quiz to understand what drives you.You can also send a short ToMo survey to your team, division, or entire organization, to understand what drives your culture.The survey is free, and takes only a few minutes to complete.</p>
